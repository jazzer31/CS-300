•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
	The problem I was tasked with solving was to build a CLI program that would load information from a file into a data structure that would function like a database. It was requested that the ability to search and display courses be added as well as the ability to print all courses with one command
•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
	The first step of my approach was to select a data structure to use I placed a premium on speed and scalability as such I chose to use a hash map. I chose a hash map knowing that I would need to sort the courses every time that all courses were printed, the speed at which hash maps can read data in and the fast access speeds make up for the added overhead of needing to sort the course separately
•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
	I did a good bit of research and debugging I had a bit of a time getting the hashing just right. But by shear persistence I was able to get it dialed in pretty good
•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  This project and the course as a whole has really driven home the importance of comparing options and thinking through how a particular data structure may affect the performance of the program
•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
	I have a better understanding of the patterns the are used to accomplish certain tasks that are common in programs, this means that I can be more consistent with how I solve the problems. I also feel that the code I am writing now requires minimum rewrites to be ported to different programs
